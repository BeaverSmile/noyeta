                    <p class = "title main-font">
                        I am a <strong><i>huge</i></strong> yoga fan, and there are so many great yoga videos on YouTube. There are 3 problems I faced when looking for videos:
                        </br>
                        <ol class = "title main-font">
                            <li><strong>The same results are at the top every time.</strong> This means I either do
                            the same routines every time, or I have to dig deep for a fresh video.</li> 
                            <li><strong>YouTube can be distracting.</strong> When I load it up and it shows me the feed of recommended videos, it's easy to get side tracked.</li>
                            <li><strong>Which video is the "one"?</strong> With so many choices, it's easy to get overwhelmed with finding the "best" one for the moment.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="title main-font">Solution</h3>

                        Noyeta is a collection of Pilates/Yoga/Relief YouTube videos organized by length of time or what they target.
                        It randomly picks a video from a pool based on your desired routine. 
                        No more hunting down videos! You won't get distracted either since the only thing between you and your ideal 
                        video is a few button clicks.
